        <h3> Goals </h3>
          <p> The longer I study software development, the more I feel like I can understand the language and turn it into something visual. Previously, I was able to vaguely copy the language into working code using my instructor’s examples as a blueprint, but this week I am noting that I am better at retaining and explaining it. I will continue to be aware of how often and quickly I am able to answer the question of “why isn’t this working?!” or even “why is this working…?”. The stacked learning modules used by Code Fellows, thus far, is a method that seems to be effective to my natural learning style. I hope that in the future my grasp on the fundamentals continues to aid me in being successful with more complex coding concept. </p>
